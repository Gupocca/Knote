Hello, world!
============

This is Knote, a simplistic note-taking application that uses CommonMark and $\KaTeX$. Typical stylings such as **bold**, *italic*, and `monospaced` are supported.

Inline math, such as $y = 5x^2 +7\alpha$, is denoted by dollar signs. Oh, you just wanted to represent a dollar amount? Escape the character with a backslash, like so: \$23.00. For centered math, try out the *double* dollar signs.

$$\displaystyle 1 + \frac{q^2}{(1-q)}+\frac{q^6}{(1-q)(1-q^2)}+\cdots = \prod_{j=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(1-q^{5j+2})(1-q^{5j+3})}, \quad\quad \text{for }\lvert q\rvert<1.$$

You can also use numbered lists, of course:
1. dolor
2. sit
3. amet

Horizontal lines are cool.
